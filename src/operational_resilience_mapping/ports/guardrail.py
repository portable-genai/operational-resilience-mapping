"""GuardrailPort: the boundary that screens a generation call in both directions (rule R1).

Rule R1 is the reason this port exists: a service that binds ``agent-guardrail-gateway`` as a
mandatory dependency must screen every inbound prompt BEFORE it reaches a model, and every
outbound answer AFTER it is produced and BEFORE it is used. ``domain/studio_service.py`` calls
:meth:`GuardrailPort.screen` around its one generation call (the tolerance narration) in exactly
that shape: the prompt as sent, which carries the caller-supplied service name and the compliance
port's regulatory prose, and then the narrative the model returned.

The domain stays pure. This port names the screen; the adapters (not this module) depend on the
managed guardrail service (Model Armor) or a local heuristic stand-in.

        Never raises on a policy match: a block is reported as ``GuardrailVerdict(allowed=False,

        carries ``sanitized_text``, the text the caller uses from then on EXACTLY as given (the
        input unchanged when nothing was redacted, possibly empty when everything was); the
        caller never falls back to the unscreened original.

        Raising is reserved for the adapter being unable to decide at all: its backend errored
        or timed out, no template is configured, or the on-prem placeholder is bound. The domain
        treats every such raise as a refusal (fail closed) and audits it.

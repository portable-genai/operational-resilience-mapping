# monitoring.tf: log-based metrics and alert policies for the posture signals.
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-07 / P-09 (detect, do not merely record): DATA_READ logging (logging_worm.tf) records
#         reads, but recording is not detection. These metrics and policies SURFACE the events
#         that mean the posture slipped, rather than leaving the signal unread in the WORM
#         bucket for the length of the retention window.
#
# Every filter below names a field this deployment actually emits:
#   - critical_escalations : the managed audit adapter writes AuditEvent as a struct payload,
#     so jsonPayload.decision is "escalated", "allowed" or "blocked" (domain/kernel.py Decision) and
#     jsonPayload.severity carries the band. A critical escalation is a maker-checker event a
#     reviewer has to see; the deterministic core decided it, so it is never noise.
#   - sa_key_creation : an exportable service-account key was created. Org policy should have
#     refused it (org_policy.tf), so this firing means the policy is off or was overridden.
#   - vpc_sc_denials : a VPC Service Controls violation. In dry run this is the evidence used
#     to decide whether enforcing would break a legitimate path.
#   - cmek_changes : a CMEK key destroy or update. Key material changing is a P-09 event.
#   - edge_denials : Cloud Armor denied or throttled a request at the edge.
#
#   - guardrail_blocks : the guardrail (rule R1) refused the tolerance narration's prompt or the
#     model's narrative, or could not decide. The studio audits each refusal with
#     jsonPayload.decision "blocked" (domain/studio_service.py) before the deterministic prose
#     stands in, so a burst here is an injection attempt or a guardrail outage, either of which
#     someone has to look at.
#
# Alert policies are always created; var.alert_notification_channels attaches the channels.
#
# NOTE for template maintainers: copied into a render VERBATIM. No Jinja here.
